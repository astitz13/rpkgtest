# rpkgtest

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of rpkgtest is to enable me to practice creating an R package. This package includes a Hello, World function as well as a function to square numbers.

## Installation

You can install the development version of rpkgtest from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("astitz13/rpkgtest")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows how this package works:

```{r example}
library(rpkgtest)
hello()
square(5)
```

You can also plot the square of a range:

```{r plot}
library(rpkgtest)
plot(square(1:10))
```
